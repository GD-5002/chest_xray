# 🫁 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-ray using Deep Learning

A web-based application that uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to detect **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images. Built with TensorFlow, converted to TFLite for lightweight deployment, and served using **Streamlit**.

## 📌 Features

- Upload chest X-ray images directly through the browser
- Real-time prediction: "Pneumonia" or "Normal"
- Model optimized with TensorFlow Lite for efficient inference
- Streamlit-powered user interface
- Fully deployed and accessible online

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Input Shape**: `(224, 224, 3)`
- **CNN Layers**: Depthwise Separable Convolutions + BatchNorm
- **Pooling**: MaxPooling
- **Fully Connected Layers**
- **Output**: Binary classification (Sigmoid activation)

   cd chest_xray

⚙️ Requirements
Python 3.9+

TensorFlow Lite Runtime

Streamlit

NumPy, Pillow, etc.

(All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt)

🏥 Dataset
The model was trained on a subset of the Chest X-ray dataset from Kaggle, containing:

Normal X-rays

Pneumonia-infected X-rays

📊 Model Performance
Metric	Score
Accuracy	~95%
